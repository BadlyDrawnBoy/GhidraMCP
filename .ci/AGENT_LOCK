# Ghidra MCP bridge workspace lock
#
# This file is created by automation before starting work on the bridge.
# Populate it with a JSON document containing:
#   {
#     "owner": "agent-or-human-identifier",
#     "branch": "feature/deterministic-bridge",
#     "task": "BOOT-RUNTIME",
#     "expires_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
#   }
#
# Agents must respect the following rules:
# - If the file exists and `expires_at` is in the future, abort to avoid concurrent work.
# - Update `task` as you progress through `.plan/tasks.manifest.json`.
# - Refresh `expires_at` (ISO-8601 UTC) every time you push new commits.
# - Delete the file only after the PR is merged or explicitly handed off.
#
# Keeping this file up to date prevents parallel runs from clobbering the single
# deterministic bridge branch.
